# Smart-Agriculture-system-using-Arduino
Farmers fail to get good profits from agricultural systems like greenhouse as they are unable to
manage various factors that affect the plant growth and productivity. Greenhouses help maintain
climatic conditions which are protected by a roof, and these arrangements are used for
cultivating crops which require a certain level of temperature, moisture. It is essential to ensure
that the temperature does not fall beyond a certain degree as increase in humidity can lead to
crop transpiration, condensation of water vapor and water evaporation from the humid soil. To
overcome these challenges, the smart agriculture monitoring system can be employed. The tools
used are Tinkercad, Arduino and Proteus software to complete this project. Temperature, soil
moisture, lightning, and security gate system are designed using Arduino and Proteus in
Tinkercad. This project has been designed to monitor, control and maintain the appropriate
conditions in the greenhouse.
